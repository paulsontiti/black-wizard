  My name is AL-amin Muhammad.I'm a Full Stack Web Developer,
   I've gained valuable experience in developing
    and maintaining front-end code for web applications.
     I have successfully transformed app designs into front-end code using ReactJs,
      NextJs.tailwind/Material UI, ensuring that the released content is compatible across 
      different browsers and devices. I have also developed a web application

       Throughout my 7 years of experience in this field,
        I have honed my skills in debugging errors, 
        troubleshooting issues, and performing routine performance optimizations.
         I have a strong understanding of user interface and user experience (UI/UX)
          design principles, allowing me to write high-quality, scalable, and reusable code.
           Additionally, I stay up to date with emerging technologies and industry trends to
            ensure that I am always at the forefront of best practices in web development.
 I hold a Post Graduate Diploma degree in computer science and have a solid foundation
  in ReactJs, NextJs, Material UI, REST, and GitHub. I am also very good with TypeScript,
   JavaScript, CSS, HTML and MongoDB and have experience testing and debugging work on
    multiple browsers and screen sizes.
     My ability to work effectively in a team and my strong work ethic make me
      a fast learner and a valuable asset to any project.
